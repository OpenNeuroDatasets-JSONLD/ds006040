This dataset includes simultaneous recordings of electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) from 28 participants aged 19 to 42 years. The fMRI and DWI data were acquired using a 3T MRI scanner (Siemens Magnetom Prisma), and the EEG was recorded using 64 channels (Brain Product BrainCap MR with Multirodes).

The following tasks were performed: resting state (eyes open and closed), checkerboard (15Hz), gradCPT, and imagery task. Raw files can be found in the subfolders, while preprocessed files are available in the derivatives folder. For more detailed information about the file structure, please refer to the readme files.
